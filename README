# The Skin Crawler
a script to generate soundsphere(https://github.com/semyon422/soundsphere) skin files
named by Hugged

It's capable of generating a rough, but working skin.
TODO:
- judgements(what you're shown during play is user defined, what you're shown in the result screen is calculated by the game regardless of that)
- key images
- lane colours(if possible)
- make a detailed writeup on the wiki about every command
- make it more configureable
