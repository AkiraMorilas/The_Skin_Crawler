# The Skin Crawler
a script to generate soundsphere(https://github.com/semyon422/soundsphere) skin files
named by Hugged

TODO:
- judgements(what you're shown during play is user defined, what you're shown in the result screen is calculated by the game regardless of that)
- key images
- lane colours(if possible)
- collumn widths
- adjustable hit position
- measure lines
- actually generate *.skin.lua files
- make a detailed writeup on the wiki about every command
